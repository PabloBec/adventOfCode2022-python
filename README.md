# adventOfCode2022-python

My name is Pablo and I am currently a university student in Spain. I'm graduating in Mathematics and Physics, so I'm mostly learning to code for fun in my free time.
These are the solutions that I used to solve what I could in the Advent of Code 2022 challenge, using mostly Python.

I hope you enjoy it and let me know every possible way to make my code better. Thank you!
